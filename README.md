# MP3 to WAV Converter


## Overview

Before running this script, you need to have ffmpeg installed on your system. You can download ffmpeg from the official website: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html
## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the mp3_to_wav_converter.py file.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the mp3_to_wav_converter.py file.
4. Run the following command:

```bash
python mp3_to_wav_converter.py input_folder output_folder
```

Replace input_folder and output_folder with the actual folder paths on your system. The script will convert all MP3 files in the input_folder and save the WAV files in the output_folder.
## Example

Suppose you have a folder called mp3_files containing some MP3 files that you want to convert to WAV format and save in a folder called wav_files. Here's how you would use the script:

```bash
python mp3_to_wav_converter.py mp3_files wav_files
```

The script will convert all MP3 files in the mp3_files folder and save the WAV files in the wav_files folder.
